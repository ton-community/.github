## What we do

Our solution is focused to make a life of every TON Developer easier. We build a TON Infrastructure layer. We are building a community-driven resource center for the TON blockchain. Documentation, tools, and more.

For example - we maintain the official TON Documentation, which is available at [ton.org/docs](https://ton.org/docs).

Also, we're taking care about other useful tools for developers such:
- [VS Code extension](https://github.com/ton-community/vscode-func) for FunC language.
- [TON Compiler](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-compiler) - Packaged Func compiler for TON smart contracts.
- [FunC-js](https://github.com/ton-community/func-js) - Cross-platform bindings for TON FunC compiler.
- find more [repositories](https://github.com/orgs/ton-community/repositories)

## How to join the open-source?

If you are a developer, you can contribute to the projects, or add your own. Also, we are looking for people who can help with documentation.

In addition, here you can get help in creating such projects, that useful for the community. If you help community - community helps you. Win-win situation.

To receive compensation, you can write a [TON Footstep](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps) or find an already placed one.
