## What we do

Our solution is focused to make a life of every TON Developer easier. We build a TON Infrastructure layer. We are building a community-driven resource center for the TON blockchain. Documentation, tools, and more.

Some examples:
â€” TON Documentation, which is available at [ton.org/docs](https://ton.org/docs)
- [VS Code extension](https://github.com/ton-community/vscode-func) for FunC language.
- [TON Compiler](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-compiler) - Packaged Func compiler for TON smart contracts.
- [FunC-js](https://github.com/ton-community/func-js) - Cross-platform bindings for TON FunC compiler.

## Why it's so cool to join?

__For contributors__

If you are a developer, you can contribute to the projects, or add your own. Also, we are looking for people who can help with documentation.

To receive compensation, you can write a [TON Footstep](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps) or find an already placed one.

__For tool builders__

After your project becomes a part of the TON Community, you'll receive more support from open-source contributors from the community.

To receive compensation for open-sourcing a tool that is useful for TON devs, please write a [TON Footstep](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps).
