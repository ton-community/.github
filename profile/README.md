## Why it's so cool to join?

__For contributors__

If you are a developer, you can contribute to the projects, or add your own. Also, we are looking for people who can help with documentation.

To receive compensation, you can write a [TON Footstep](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps) or find an already placed one.

__For tool builders__

After your project becomes a part of the TON Community, you'll receive more support from open-source contributors from the community.

To receive compensation for open-sourcing a tool or smart-contract that is useful for TON devs, please write a [TON Footstep](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps).
