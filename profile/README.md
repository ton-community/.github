## What we do

Our solution is focused on making the life of the TON developer easier. We are building a community-driven center for the TON blockchain. SDK, tools, documentation, and more.

Some examples:
- TON Documentation, which is available at [docs.ton.org](https://docs.ton.org/)
- [TON Developer](https://ton.org/dev) â€“ an entry point for TON developers. Offers high-level guides, SDK overviews, API docs, Mini App tutorials, and integration standards like TON Connect.
- [TON Developer Tools](https://github.com/ton-org) â€“ a source code hub for TON tools and libraries. Includes SDKs, compilers, development environments likeÂ blueprintÂ andÂ sandbox, and TypeScript/JS bindings. 
- [Blueprint](https://github.com/ton-community/blueprint) â€” a development environment for TON for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
- [Sandbox](https://github.com/ton-community/sandbox) â€” a package to test your TON smart contracts.
- [TON IDE Plugins](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/getting-started/ide-plugins)Â â€“Â official plugins for popular code editors to enhance TON smart contract development.
